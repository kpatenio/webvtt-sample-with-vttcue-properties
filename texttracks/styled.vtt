NOTE: when `line` is altered to use an integer or a percentage, the
the `snap-to-lines` flag is set to false. Otherwise, it is set to true,
and the line property defaults to "auto".
See https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/#webvtt-cue-snap-to-lines-flag for more information.

Update: snap-to-lines can technically be overrided, if we wish to not use line or percentage
to determine cue order.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 line:100%
Bottom cue

NOTE: without align:end, cue could move out of bounds

Bottom right cue

NOTE: without align:start, cue could move out of bounds
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000 line:100% position:0% align:start
Bottom left cue

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 line:0%
Top cue

NOTE: without align:end, cue could move out of bounds

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:0% position:100% align:end
Top right cue

NOTE: without align:start, cue could move out of bounds

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:0% position:0% align:start

NOTE: without align:end, cue could move out of bounds

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:50% position:0% align:start
Left cue

NOTE: without align:end, cue could move out of bounds

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 line:50% position:100% align:end
Right cue

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:50% position:50% align:center
Center cue

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:40% position:50% vertical:lr
Vertical left to right

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:60% position:50% vertical:rl
Vertical right to left

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 line:100% position:50% size:20% align:center
This is longer text to test cue size. Notice centered alignment.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:50% position:20% size:20% align:start
This is the same cue size. Notice start alignment.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:50% position:80% size:20% align:end
This is the same cue size. Notice end alignment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 line:50% position:0% size:100% align:start
This is size 100%. Now test this with much longer text. It should go across video width.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000 line:2
Integer used for line number. Defined first.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000 line:1
Integer used for line number. Defined last.

snapToLines1
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:2
Defined first - line 2 cue - snap flag overriden.

snapToLines2
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:1
Defined last - line 1 cue - snap flag overriden.
